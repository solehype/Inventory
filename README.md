<H2>READ-ME</H2>

Removes duplicate rows by looping though a csv and 
saving a cell in a cache of the last row looped then 
checking the next row vs the cache continually.

Note: The duplicate column index & doc 
delimeter can be adjusted with variables. 

Important: The spread sheet needs to be sorted
by the duplicate column index with an external 
spread sheet viewer
